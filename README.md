- My approach to this was to get an understanding of what was being asked of me to do. Then I make a strategy on how I will be able to achieve my end goal of creating my desired project. Once the plan has been laid out, I move to execute the plan. OpenGL is brand new to me so understanding how this library works together, has helped me to be able to visualize the creatiion of the 3D virtual world in a whole new way. It as also opened my eyes to how hololens works in a way as well. A great deal of research came into play when it came to being able to understand how everything work. I feel after reading over the material numerous times has helped me grasp everything. Relentless research will help me get to the same north star for future projects. I dont think there was anything new that I learned as far as development skills. Iteration factored into my development by creating eachh shape one interation at a time so I can see how everything was coming together. I think my apprach moving forward will be to look ahead at future material that has yet to be learned by me. I think with this work applying some of the older logic didnt work well with future logic we were taught later on. Computer Science can help me reach my goal by helping me understand how I can innovate current things in the world. Everything I learned was new and will help me expand my skill set to tackle new issues I may encounter in educucational and professional pathways.
